**Objective:** Resolve the build failure.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify the root cause:** The build was failing because the project files were not in the remote GitHub repository.
2.  **Add files to git:** Added all project files to a new git commit.
3.  **Set remote origin:** Added the GitHub repository as the remote origin.
4.  **Resolve merge conflict:** Resolved a merge conflict in the `README.md` file by choosing the remote version.
5.  **Push to remote:** Pushed all project files to the remote repository.
